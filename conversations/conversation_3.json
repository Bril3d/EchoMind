      "content": "Ah, exams. It's completely understandable that you're feeling anxious about them today. That feeling in your stomach, the racing thoughts... anxiety can be a really powerful emotion. It sounds like you're carrying a lot right now.\n\nJust taking a moment to acknowledge that feeling is a brave step. Many people try to push anxiety away, but facing it head-on, like you're doing, can be really helpful.\n\nPerhaps it might be helpful to think about what specifically is making you anxious? Is it the fear of not knowing the material, the pressure to perform well, or something else entirely? Sometimes, just identifying the root of the anxiety can help to lessen its grip.\n\nThink of anxiety like a wave. It can feel overwhelming as it builds, but like all waves, it eventually crests and recedes. Right now, you might be feeling that build-up. Remember to breathe. Deep, slow breaths can be surprisingly grounding.\n\nI'm here to listen if you'd like to talk more about what's on your mind. Sharing those worries can sometimes make them feel a little lighter. And remember, you've prepared for these exams, and you're capable. Focus on taking things one question at a time.\n\nHow are you feeling now, just acknowledging these feelings? And is there anything specific I can help you process further, or anything else on your mind?\n"

      "content": "I hear you. You're feeling depressed. Thank you for sharing that with me; it takes courage to name that feeling. It's okay to not be okay, and it's important to acknowledge that you're experiencing this heaviness. Depression can feel like a dark cloud that makes everything seem difficult and overwhelming. It’s not something you just snap out of, and it’s important to treat yourself with kindness and understanding right now.\n\nDepression manifests in so many different ways for different people. Perhaps you're feeling a deep sadness, a lack of motivation, or maybe even just a general sense of emptiness. Maybe you're finding it hard to concentrate, or you've lost interest in things you usually enjoy. Whatever it is, it’s valid.\n\nOften, depression can feel isolating, like you're the only one going through this. But please know that you're not alone. Many people experience depression at some point in their lives, and there are resources and support available to help you navigate this.\n\nHave you been feeling this way for a while, or is this a more recent experience? Sometimes understanding the duration and potential triggers can be a helpful starting point. And more importantly, is there anything specific that you feel comfortable sharing with me about what might be contributing to this feeling? Even small details can sometimes help us understand the bigger picture.\n\nFor now, remember to be gentle with yourself. Try to do one small thing that might bring you a little comfort, even if it feels difficult. Maybe that's listening to a favorite song, taking a warm shower, or simply stepping outside for a few minutes of fresh air.\n\nI'm here to listen without judgment, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid and important. How are you feeling now, after sharing this with me? And what feels like the most pressing aspect of this depression that we could explore together right now?\n"
