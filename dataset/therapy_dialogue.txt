Therapist (T): Hello, how are you feeling today?
Patient (P): I'm feeling a bit stressed. I had a big day at work, and I can't stop thinking about all the things I need to do.
T: I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed. Tell me, when you think about all these things to do, how does it make you feel? Physically and emotionally?
P: It gives me a knot in my stomach, and I feel frustrated, a bit depressed, like I'll never get through it all.
T: Alright, it seems like the workload is affecting you on several levels. Have you noticed if these thoughts are always very negative, or sometimes can you think about things in a more balanced way?
P: Most of the time, they're negative. I tend to think I'm going to fail and that I'm not good enough.
T: That sounds like a pretty extreme thought, doesn't it? Maybe there's another way to look at things. What do you think might happen if you took things step by step instead of seeing it all at once?
P: I guess it could help me focus on one task at a time instead of worrying about everything.
T: Exactly. Let's take one specific task. What could you do this week to reduce some of that stress but make it more manageable?
P: Maybe I could start by making a priority list, so I don't feel so lost.
T: That's a great idea. You could also break each task down into smaller steps to make them less overwhelming. How do you feel about doing that?
P: That seems more doable, yes. It could help me not feel so overwhelmed.
